# FOSSASIA Summit 2023

![Group photo](photos/group-photo.jpg)

On the 13th, 14th, and 15th of April 2023, [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) has been invited to run a community booth at the FOSSASIA summit, an in-person and online event in Singapore at the Lifelong Learning Institute. It was an amazing opportunity to showcase our projects and ideas at Asia's largest open-source conferences.

We quickly got to work before the conference, organizing volunteers to man the booth and brainstorming ideas to make the most of the event. A challenge was set up for FOSSASIA participants to draw their versions of Orpheus, which resulted in some… [creative dinos being drawn.](photos/challenge)

Overall, the summit was a remarkable experience for all of us, and we look forward to continuing our efforts to promote our open-source projects and mission in events like this.
